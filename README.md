# AI Agent Development Lab

This repository is a dedicated space for the **design, development, and experimentation of autonomous AI agents**. Our goal is to create agents that perceive, reason, plan, and act within simulated or real environments using modular, scalable, and adaptable architectures.

We leverage AI-assisted tools such as GitHub Copilot and large language models to enhance developer productivity, accelerate experimentation, and explore novel approaches—but the focus remains firmly on **building better agents**, not just on how they’re built.

---

## 🎯 Mission

To create a flexible, collaborative ecosystem for AI agent development that supports:

- Exploration of diverse agent architectures, behaviors, and capabilities
- Reusable and composable components (planners, memory, sensors, etc.)
- Fast iteration using AI-assisted tooling
- Transparent documentation of agent logic, decisions, and design evolution

This is a hands-on lab—not a polished product. Expect rapid prototyping, imperfect code, weird experiments, and a growing library of intelligent systems.

---

## 🧱 What You Can Build

- Autonomous agents with custom planning strategies (LLM, rule-based, RL, hybrid)
- Memory systems (episodic, vector, contextual, stateless)
- Modular behavior layers and execution loops
- Simulated environments for benchmarking adaptation, planning, and learning
- Evaluation pipelines to track agent performance and behavioral drift
- Prompt-driven components that complement classical logic

## 🧠 Development Philosophy

- **Agents First**  
  Our focus is on building high-quality, intelligent agents. The tools, techniques, and strategies serve that purpose.

- **Modularity Always**  
  Agents should be built from interchangeable components—allowing for easy comparison, substitution, and experimentation.

- **AI-Assisted, Not AI-Owned**  
  Use tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, or Claude to help brainstorm, scaffold, and prototype—but always validate, refine, and take ownership of logic.

- **Think, Build, Test, Repeat**  
  Begin with a hypothesis or behavior goal, build toward it, test it thoroughly, and document the result—success or failure.

- **Log the Journey**  
  Track every meaningful insight, mistake, or behavior change in `/logs/`. Decision rationale is as important as code.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or fork this repo.
2. Explore existing agents in `/agents/`.
3. Choose a component to modify or build new functionality under `/modules/`.
4. Run agents using the testing environments in `/sandbox/`.
5. Use AI tools to assist as needed, but ensure human-reviewed output.
6. Document what you learned in `/logs/experiments.md`.
7. Submit a pull request summarizing:
   - What you built or changed
   - What worked or failed
   - What was AI-assisted
   - Next steps or open questions
